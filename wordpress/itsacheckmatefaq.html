          For most integrations, you may want to use your tablet for certain functions such as 86ing, throttling,
          refunding, canceling orders, etc. Also, in the rare case where a specific order will not integrate, our
          support team may refer you to the tablet for order details. For a few integrations, there are specific things
          you should know:

          Most orders will show up within seconds. In rare cases, orders may take a little longer due to changes to the
          delivery service menu, the POS menu, POS or delivery service system outages, or other similar causes. In the
          event an order provided to Checkmate is unable to be sent through our integration (e.g. when an item was added
          to the delivery service but not to the POS), our team will contact you via pre-established channels to try to
          make sure you are still able to complete the order before the driver arrives.

        <p class="answer-text">
          This is almost always caused by mismatched prep times between your delivery services and your POS. If you
          verify these are synchronized and still see drivers showing up early, please contact Checkmate customer
          support.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="answer-text">
          Generally, an order will print based on your prep time. If it is a future order, and your prep time is 15
          minutes, the order will not print until 15 minutes before it is due. Some of our integrations send the order
          ready time as the time that their driver will be able to make it to your store, even if that time is longer
          than your prep time. For instance, if your prep time is 20 minutes, but they can't schedule a driver for 60
          minutes, they will send in an order ready time of 60 minutes. Depending on your POS configuration, this may
          cause the ticket to not show on the KDS or print until 20 minutes (or whatever your prep time is) before the
          time the driver is to arrive to ensure the food is fresh and hot.

          This generally happens when printer settings in the POS are changed. Most of the time, this can be addressed
          by calling your POS support team. If they are not able to correct this, please reach out to Checkmate’s

          This is sometimes caused by a technical glitch, but most of the time it is due to the delivery service sending
          duplicate orders to our system. If this happens, please let the customer service team know and they’ll be
          happy to help investigate and determine whether it’s something that can be corrected by Checkmate.

          <strong>POS is offline:</strong> If the POS is offline, the customer's order will not reach the POS. If the
          delivery service tablet is online, the order will still be processed and appear on the tablet.

          <strong>Missing item or modifier:</strong> While this is rare, there are times when an order can’t be

          team is available 24/7 to keep an eye on such instances. When this occurs, if configured, we will immediately
          notify the kitchen using a "Notification ticket". The Notification ticket will display the following
          information:

          Discounts to the customers funded by delivery services won't be included in the order total sent to the POS.
          For discounts that you would like to provide yourselves, most of our integrations include the ability to send
          specific dollar value or percent discounts through. None of our integrations allow us to send in arbitrary
          dollar value discounts.

          By default, our integrations use the prices that are specified in the POS, not the delivery services. However,
          we can work with most POS integrations to add on a menu-wide percentage based surcharge or service fee. Let
          our service team know if this is something you need.

          It is common for tax values that appear on the POS to differ from the tax values calculated by the delivery
          service. Orders will still be processed and accepted by the POS and the tax values set on the POS are
          considered to be the accurate values.

        <p class="answer-text">
          No. Refunds must be issued on the delivery service’s tablet or web portal. Refunding via the delivery service
          will cause a discrepancy when comparing the sales from the delivery service and POS reports.

          For most integrations, the inclusion of our integrated orders into your reports is automatic. We will work
          with you to configure your system so that you can split these orders up into their various order sources, as
          well as the type of order (e.g. delivery, pick up, catering, etc). Some integrations require more work for
          this to happen, and a few do not allow us to send orders in a way that is easily split up.
